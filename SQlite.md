# SQLite Browser

* SQLite is a very popular database - it is free and fast and small
* SQlite Browser allows us to directly  manipulate SQLite files
	* http://sqlitebrowser.org/
* There is also a Firefox plugin to manipulate SQLite
	* https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/
* SQLite is embedded in Python and a number of other languages

## SQL Insert

* The Insert statment inserts a rwo into a table
* INSERT INTO Users(name, email) VALUES('Kristin', 'kf@umich.edu')

## SQL Delete

* Deletes a row in a table based on a selection criteria
* DELETE FROM Users WHERE email='ted@umich.edu'

## SQL: Update

* Allows the updating of a field with a WHERE clause
* UPDATE Users SET name='Charles' WHERE email='csev@umich.edu'

## Retrieving Records: Select

* The select statement retrieves a group of records - you can either retrieve all the records or a subset of the records with a WHERE clause
* SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email='csev@umich.edu'

## Sorting with ORDER BY

* You can add an ORDER BY clause to SELECT statements to get the results sorted in ascending or descending order
* SELECT * FROM Users ORDER BY email
* SELECT * FROM Users ORDER BY name
