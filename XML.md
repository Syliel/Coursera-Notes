Python Dictionary ---> Serialize ---> De-serialize ---> Java HashMap  
Two types of serialization = XML (older), JSON (newer)

## XML eXtensible Markup Language:
* Primary purpose is to help information systems share structured
data
* It started as a simplified subset of the Standard Generalized Markup
Language (SGML), and is designed to be relatively human-legible

* XML "Elements" (or Nodes): < = start tag, /= end tag
```xml
<people>
 <person>
  <name>Jenni</name>      <---- Simple Element
  <phone>303 4456</phone>
 </person>                <---- Complex Element
  <name>Noah</name>       
  <phone>622 7421</phone>
 </person>
</people>
```
* XML Basics: White space doesn't matter, except in between text content
```xml
<person>                      <---- Start Tag
 <name>Chuck</name>
 <phone type="intl">          <---- Attribute (Key Value pairs, Always on Start)
  +1 734 303 4456             <---- Text Content
 </phone>
 <email hide="yes"/>          <---- Self Closing Tag
</person>                     <---- End Tag  
```
* XML Schema:
	*Describing a "contract" as to what is acceptable XML.
	*Description of the legal format of an XML document
	*Expressed in terms of constraints on the structure and content of
	documents
	*Often used to specify a "contract" between systems - "My system
	will only accept XML that conforms to this particular Schema."
	*If a particular piece of XML meets the specification of the Schema
	it is said to "validate"

* Many XML Schema Languages
	*Document Type Definition (DTD)
		*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Type_Definition
	*Standard Generalized Markup Language (ISO 8879:1986 SGML)
		*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGML
	*XML Schema from W3C - (XSD)
		*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Schema_(W3C)

* XML Schema from W3c - (XSD) is mostly used

* XDS XML Schema (W3C spec):
	
	*We will focus on the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) version
	*It is often called "W3C Schema" because "Schema" is considered generi		c
	*More commonly it is called XSD because the file names end in .xsd
	*Date format: YYYY-MM-DD Date/Time: YYYY-MM-DDT09:30:10Z (Z is timezon		e UTC)
	*Timezone - typically specified in UTC/GMT rather than local time zone
