# RELATIONAL DATABASES

Relational databases model data by storing rows and columns in tables. The
power of the relational database lies in its ability to efficiently retrieve
data from those tables and in particular where there are multiple tables and
the relationships between those tables involved in the query.

  * Database = Contains many tables.
  * Relation (or table) = Contains tuples and attributes.
  * Tuple (or row) = A set of fields that generally represents an "object" like a
person or a music track.
  * Attribute (also column or field) = One of possibly many elements of data
corresponding to the object represented by the row.
