Each character is represented by a number between 0 and 256 stored in 8 bits of memory.

We refer to "8 bits of memory as a "byte" of memory - (i.e. my disk drive contains 3 Terabytes of memory)

The ord() function tells us the numeric value of a simple ASCII character

print(ord('H'))

Hexadecimal = Base16
Oct = Base8
Binary = 0s and 1s

Unicode is universal code for character sets (unicode.org/charts/)


Multi-Byte Characters

To represent the wide range of characters computers must handle we reprsent characters with more than one byte

	UTF-16 = Fixed length - Two bytes
	UTF-32 = Fixed length - Four bytes
	UTF-8 = 1-4 bytes
	 *Upwards compatible with ASCII
	 *Automatic detection between ASCII and UTF-8
	 *UTF-8 is recommended practice for encoding data to be exchanged 
		between systems

In Python 3, all strings internally are UNICODE

Working with string variables in Python programs and reading data from files usually "just works"

When we talk to a network resource using sockets or talk to a database we have to encode and decode data (usually to UTF-8)

When we talk to an external resource like a network socket we send bytes, so we need to encode Python 3 strings into a given character encoding

When we read data from an external resource, we must decode it based on the character set so it is properly represented in Python 3 as a string

while True:
	data = mysock.recv(512)
	if ( len(data) < 1 ):
		break
	mystring = data.decode()
	print(mystring)
